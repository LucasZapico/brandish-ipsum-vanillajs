## Project Story 

The other day I was building an e-commerce site and needed to add ipsum for product descriptions and because variety is the spice of life. I looked at my favorite ipsum generators, [Priate ipsum](https://pirateipsum.me/), [Office Ipsum](http://officeipsum.com/) and [Cupcake Ipsum](http://www.cupcakeipsum.com/). This time I went with Cupcake ipsum, it ended up working out fine. But I found myself wondering how I could get more on brand ipsum. Similar to how we find placeholder imagery that aligns with the product we are creating. We have decent array of community built apps, packages, etc for placeholder avatars, unsplash images etc. But with regards to copy we seem limited to lore ipsum or humorous alternatives. This community need prompted me to try and created a tool that would allow a creator to use more brand aligned ipsum by leveraging the keywords that other business in the market use. Thus Brandish Ipsum was born.
